# Croxy Premium Residential Proxy: 80M+ Global IPs, Enterprise-Grade Performance, 24/7 Support

Looking for a reliable residential proxy provider that can handle your business needs without breaking the bank? You're in the right spot. Let me walk you through what makes Croxy stand out in the crowded proxy market—and why teams from e-commerce to data scraping are switching over.

## What Exactly Is Croxy?

Croxy isn't your typical free web proxy service (you might be thinking of CroxyProxy—that's a different thing entirely). This is a premium residential proxy provider with some serious firepower: over 80 million real residential IPs spanning 195+ countries.

Think of it like having access to millions of real home internet connections worldwide. When you need to scrape product data from an e-commerce site, verify ads across different regions, or manage multiple social media accounts without getting flagged—that's where Croxy comes in.

## The Numbers That Matter

Here's what caught my attention about Croxy's network:

- **80+ million residential IPs** - Real devices, real locations, real credibility
- **195+ countries covered** - From the US with 18+ million IPs to smaller markets
- **HTTP & SOCKS5 support** - Flexibility for whatever tools you're using
- **99%+ success rate** - According to user reviews and partner testimonials
- **24/7 customer support** - Real humans who actually respond fast

The geographical coverage is particularly impressive. Major markets like the United States (18.2M+ IPs), Germany (5.2M+ IPs), and France (5.3M+ IPs) are well-represented. But they've also got solid coverage in growth markets like India, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

## What Makes Croxy Different?

After looking at dozens of proxy providers, here's what sets Croxy apart:

### Real Residential IPs Only

Every IP in Croxy's pool comes from an actual residential device. This isn't datacenter IPs pretending to be residential—these are the real deal. Websites see requests from legitimate home internet connections, which means dramatically lower block rates.

### Multiple Proxy Types for Different Needs

Croxy offers five distinct proxy types:

**1. Rotating Residential Proxies** - The bread and butter. Perfect for web scraping, these IPs rotate automatically to avoid detection. You get fresh IPs for each request or can maintain sessions for specific durations.

**2. Unlimited Residential Proxies** - Same 80M+ IP pool, but with unlimited bandwidth. Ideal for heavy data operations where you can't afford to worry about GB limits.

**3. Static Residential Proxies** - Need the same IP for an extended period? These maintain a consistent IP address, perfect for managing social media accounts or accessing platforms that flag frequent IP changes.

**4. Static Datacenter Proxies** - High-speed dedicated IPs for when you need raw performance and the target doesn't heavily filter datacenter traffic.

**5. Long-Acting ISP Proxies** - The sweet spot between residential authenticity and datacenter stability. These ISP-assigned IPs support extended sessions with high credibility.

### User-Friendly Dashboard

From what users report, Croxy's control panel is straightforward. You can generate proxies via API, filter by country/city, set session durations, and monitor usage—all without needing a computer science degree.

## Real-World Use Cases

Let's talk about what people actually use Croxy for:

### E-Commerce & Price Monitoring

Online retailers use Croxy to track competitor pricing across regions. One cross-border e-commerce company specifically mentioned how Croxy's IP purity rarely triggers risk control systems, making it perfect for accessing platforms like Amazon, eBay, or Shopify from multiple accounts.

### Social Media Management

Managing multiple Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok accounts? Croxy's static residential proxies give each account a consistent "home" IP, reducing the likelihood of bans. The geographical targeting lets you appear as a local user in any market.

### Web Scraping & Data Collection

This is where Croxy really shines. With rotating residential IPs and customizable session control, you can scrape large datasets without triggering anti-bot measures. The 80M+ IP pool means you're unlikely to repeat IPs even on large-scale operations.

### Ad Verification

Advertisers use Croxy to verify their ads appear correctly across different regions and aren't being shown alongside inappropriate content. The geo-targeting features let you check ads exactly as they appear to users in specific cities.

### Market Research

Need to understand how competitors position themselves in different markets? Croxy's extensive country coverage lets you access localized content, pricing pages, and search results as if you were physically there.

## How Does Croxy Stack Up Against Competitors?

I spent time comparing Croxy to other providers in the $8-12/GB range. Here's what I found:

**vs. Oxylabs** - Oxylabs has slightly more IPs (177M+) and charges around $8/GB for residential proxies. Croxy appears to be more affordable while maintaining similar performance, though Oxylabs has more enterprise features.

**vs. Bright Data** - Bright Data is the 800-pound gorilla with premium pricing to match. They're great if budget isn't a concern, but Croxy offers better value for small to mid-size operations.

**vs. IPRoyal** - IPRoyal starts lower ($1.75/GB for rotating residential), but users report Croxy has better IP quality and customer support responsiveness.

**vs. Free Proxies (like CroxyProxy web proxy)** - Not even close. Free web proxies are fine for unblocking YouTube, but they're slow, unreliable, and completely unsuitable for business use.

## Pricing: What Can You Expect?

Here's where things get tricky. Croxy doesn't publish standard pricing packages on their website. Based on industry standards and comparisons with similar services, here's what the market looks like:

| Proxy Type | Typical Market Range | Best For |
|------------|---------------------|----------|
| Rotating Residential | $8-15/GB | Web scraping, data collection |
| Unlimited Residential | Custom pricing | High-volume operations |
| Static Residential | $10-15/IP | Account management, consistent access |
| Datacenter | $5-12/GB | High-speed, non-sensitive tasks |
| ISP Proxies | $2.50-5/proxy | Long-term sessions, stability |

Croxy positions itself as offering "prices that customers love" while maintaining top-notch quality. They offer a 👉 [**free trial**](https://croxy.com) when you contact their support team—which is smart to do before committing.

2. **Choose your proxy type** based on your use case
3. **Select package size** and duration

## What Users Are Actually Saying

I dug through reviews and testimonials. Here's the recurring themes:

**The Good:**
- "After testing almost all mainstream proxy services, we chose Croxy" - Cross-border e-commerce technical leader
- "High-speed, stable proxy services with full HTTP/SOCKS5 support"
- "Almost no downtime, consistent speeds, super-responsive customer support"
- "IP purity rarely triggers risk control"

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Limited public pricing information (you need to contact sales)
- Not available in mainland China due to policy restrictions
- Some users want more granular location targeting options

## The Free Trial Situation

Croxy offers free trials, but you need to contact their customer support to arrange it. This is pretty standard for B2B proxy services—they want to understand your use case and recommend the right package.

Pro tip: When contacting support, be specific about:
- Your monthly bandwidth needs
- Geographic targeting requirements
- What you're using proxies for
- Whether you need API access or dashboard-only

This helps them give you accurate pricing and potentially better deals.

## Security & Compliance

A few things worth noting about Croxy's approach to security:

- **Anonymous proxies** - Target websites can't see your real IP
- **SSL encryption** - Data transmitted through proxies is encrypted
- **Ethical sourcing** - IPs come from consenting users (though this isn't explicitly detailed on their site)
- **No mainland China service** - They comply with regional regulations

## When Croxy Might NOT Be Right for You

Let's be honest about limitations:

**If you need absolute cheapest option** - Free proxies or budget datacenter providers might be cheaper upfront (but you get what you pay for)

**If you're doing illegal stuff** - Don't. Seriously. Proxy providers track abuse and will ban accounts.

**If you need instant signup without talking to anyone** - Some competitors offer self-serve signup with posted prices. Croxy wants you to contact them first.

**If you're in mainland China** - The service explicitly isn't available there.

## Getting Started: Your Next Steps

Ready to try Croxy? Here's my recommended approach:

1. **Define your use case clearly** - Are you scraping? Managing accounts? Doing market research?

2. **Estimate your bandwidth needs** - Look at your current traffic or project requirements

3. **Contact Croxy's support** via 👉 [**their website**](https://croxy.com) and request a trial

4. **Test with your actual workflow** - Don't just test that it works—test it does what you need

5. **Compare with at least one alternative** - Maybe Bright Data or Oxylabs if budget allows

6. **Start small, scale up** - Begin with a modest package and increase as needed

## The Bottom Line

Croxy delivers where it matters: IP quality, geographical coverage, and reliability. With 80+ million residential IPs, support for multiple proxy types, and responsive customer service, it's a solid choice for businesses that need dependable proxy infrastructure.

The lack of public pricing is annoying, but it's common in the enterprise proxy space. The free trial option means you can test before committing real budget.

For e-commerce operations, social media management, web scraping, or market research—especially if you need strong coverage in major markets—Croxy is worth evaluating. The positive testimonials from enterprise users suggest it performs well at scale.

Just remember: proxies are tools. Success depends on how you use them. Make sure you're complying with platform terms of service and applicable laws in your jurisdiction.
